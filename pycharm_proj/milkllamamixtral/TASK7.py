1. Implement a new command called `ollami config` that allows users to
configure their Ollami settings in a more user-friendly way. This command
could include subcommands such as `set`, `get`, and `unset` to allow users
to set, retrieve, or unset specific configuration values. For example:
```markdown
$ ollami config get language
en-US

$ ollami config set time_format 24h
Time format has been set to "24h".

$ ollami config unset api_key
API key has been unset.
```
1. Add support for custom scripts that users can define and run using
Ollami CLI. This could be implemented as a new command called `ollami
script`, which would allow users to define their own scripts in a simple
and intuitive way. For example:
```vbnet
$ ollami script create my_script --description "My custom script"
Script "my_script" has been created.

$ ollami script edit my_script
[opens the default editor with the script file]

$ ollami script run my_script
[runs the script and prints the output]
```
1. Implement a new command called `ollami history` that allows users to
view their command history and repeat previous commands more easily. This
command could include subcommands such as `list`, `clear`, and `repeat` to
allow users to list, clear, or repeat previous commands. For example:
```bash
$ ollami history list
1. ollami config get language
2. ollami config set time_format 24h
3. ollami script create my_script --description "My custom script"
4. ollami script edit my_script
5. ollami script run my_script

$ ollami history clear
Command history has been cleared.

$ ollami history repeat 3
[runs the third command in the history]
```
1. Add support for plugins that extend the functionality of Ollami CLI.
This could be implemented as a new command called `ollami plugin`, which
would allow users to install, manage, and uninstall plugins from within
the CLI. For example:
```sql
$ ollami plugin search weather
Weather forecast plugin

$ ollami plugin install weather
Plugin "weather" has been installed.

$ ollami weather forecast
Today's forecast: sunny, high of 75, low of 50

```css

import sys
import time

def cli():
    print("Welcome to the Ollama CLI!")
    print("Please select an option:")
    print("1. Communicate with Ollama")
    print("2. Exit")

    while True:
        try:
            choice = int(input("Enter your choice (1-2): "))
            if choice == 1:
                communicate_with_ollama()
            elif choice == 2:
                print("Exiting...")
                sys.exit()
            else:
                print("Invalid choice. Please enter a number between 1 and
2.")
        except ValueError:
            print("Invalid input. Please enter a number between 1 and 2.")

def communicate_with_ollama():
    # Code to communicate with Ollama goes here
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    while True:
        cli()
        time.sleep(1)
